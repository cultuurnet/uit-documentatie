# Update Calendar info

The calendar information for an event consists of:
- a combination `calendarType` + `openingHours` OR `calendarType` + `timestamps`
- a `startDate` and `endDate`

Note that the `status` (if applicable) should always be included in the request payload. Otherwise the status of that (sub)Event will be reverted to `Available` ([more info](#including-the-status-in-your-request))

```

## Including the status in your request
Events and subEvents can have a 'status'. This status indicates whether the (sub)Event still takes place as planned or not. The following values for ‘status’ are applicable:
* `available`: the event takes place as planned. This is the default value when no status for the event or subEvent is included.
* `temporarilyUnavailable`: the event has been postponed to a later date yet to be determined.
* `unavailable`: the event has been cancelled.

**Important notes** 
* When updating the calendarInfo without including the status of the (sub)Event in your request, UiTdatabank will assume that the status of the (sub)Event is `Available`. 
* If a (sub)Event has a status other than `Available`, you have to pass the status (`Unavailable` | `TemporarilyUnavailable`) for that (sub)Event in your request when updating the calendarInfo (see [status](https://documentatie.uitdatabank.be/content/json-ld/latest/events/event-status.html)).


## Definitions

### calendarType

An event can have one of the following calendarTypes:
- single: one timestamp
- multiple: multiple timestamps
- periodic: a period with startdate and enddate
- permanent (! we highly recommend not to use this calendarType for events, but use periodic instead)

```
  "calendarType": "periodic"
```

### timeSpans

timeSpans can be combined with calendarTypes 'single' and 'multiple'.
One timeSpan consists of a start and end date-time

```
"timeSpans": [
    {
      "start": "2019-05-07T10:00:00+00:00",
      "end": "2019-05-07T16:30:00+00:00"
    },
    {
      "start": "2019-05-08T10:00:00+00:00",
      "end": "2019-05-08T16:30:00+00:00"
    }
  ]
```


### openingHours

openingHours can be combined with calendarTypes 'periodic' and 'permanent'
openingHours contain an array of weekdays with matching opening hours and closing hours

```
    "openingHours": [
      {
        "opens": "10:00",
        "closes": "16:00",
        "dayOfWeek": [
          "monday",
          "tuesday",
          "wednesday"
        ]
      },
      {
        "dayOfWeek": [
          "thursday",
          "friday",
          "saturday"
        ],
        "opens": "09:00",
        "closes": "20:00"
      }
    ]
```

### startDate
startDate is optional for calendarType `single` and `multiple` : it will be added automatically by the API
startDate is required for calendarType `periodic`

startDate signifies the first occurence of the event

```
  "startDate": "2015-05-07T14:30:00+00:00"
```

### endDate
endDate is optional for calendarType `single` and `multiple` : it will be added automatically by the API
endDate is required for calendarType `periodic`

endDate signifies the last occurence of the event

```
  "endDate": "2015-05-07T14:30:00+00:00"
```

# Event - typicalAgeRange

For more info, see [update age range]({% link content/json-ld/latest/events/event-typical-age-range.md %}).

**Example**

```
"typicalAgeRange": "3-15"
```

Events with upper boundary smaller or equal to 12 are enriched with the 'Vlieg'-icon and published on [UiTmetvlieg](https://www.uitinvlaanderen.be/vlieg).

To specify that an event is accessible for all ages, add the typicalAgeRange `"-"`

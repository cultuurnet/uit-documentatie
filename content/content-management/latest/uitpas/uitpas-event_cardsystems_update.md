# Update event cardsystems

According to the philosophy of UiTPAS, all events of an UiTPAS organizer are by default UiTPAS events. With these endpoints you can deviate from that basic principle. 

**!Note that these endpoints may thus only be used for specific use cases where not every event from the organizer is applicable for all card systems of the organizer!**

## Host

 For documentation on UiTPAS base url, go [here]({% link content/entry_api_3/latest/authentication/authentication-baseUrl.md %})

## HTTP request

```
PUT /events/{eventId}/cardSystems/
```
Set the card systems coupled to the cultural event.
To avoid race conditions, if the event is not known by UiTPAS at the time of the request, it will still be saved and applied when it becomes known.

## Request headers

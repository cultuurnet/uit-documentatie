# Possible exceptions and deprecated data

You can already discover all features available in publiqâ€™s Search API v3 for UiTdatabank. However, there are some possible exceptions to handle in this pilot stage.

## Missing `@id` for location

* it is possible an event has **a place without `@id`**

```
"location": {
  "@type": "Place",
  "address": {
    "nl": {
      "addressCountry": "BE",
      "addressLocality": "Borgloon",
      "postalCode": "3840",
      "streetAddress": "Grootloonstraat 111a"
    }
  },
  "geo": {
    "latitude": 50.7925781,
    "longitude": 5.3658241
  }
```

We call this a dummy location; legacy data from the previous version of UiTdatabank. These places can't be ignored because they contain the address and geocoordinates needed to locate the event.


## Missing `@id` for organizer

* it is possible an event has **an organizer without `@id`**
```
"organizer": {
"name": "CodeFever VZW",
"@type": "Organizer"
},
```
We call this a dummy organizer; legacy data from the previous version of UiTdatabank. These organizers can be ignored or just used to print the name.

## availableTo

```
"availableTo": "2018-11-28T23:59:59+01:00",
```
It is possible that some events and places do not have an `availableTo` property. In that case it can be considered an event with `"availableTo": "2100-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"`.

**Important** Be mindful of the [Year 2038 problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem) when converting our dateTime to a signed 32-bit integer. The value `"2100-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"` can not be encoded to a signed 32-bit integer, please refer to one of the [possible solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem#Possible_solutions) provided in online documentation.

## completedLanguages

```
"completedLanguages": [
  "nl",
  "en"
],
```
When an offer contains all the translatable fields in one specific language, this language is added to the `completeLanguages` property.

The translatable fields are different for every entity:

**Event**
* name
* description
* bookingInfo/urlLabel*
* priceInfo/name*


**Place**
* name
* description
* address
* bookingInfo/urlLabel*
* priceInfo/name*


**Organizer**
* name
* address*

Fields marked with an `*` are not yet indexed under the `completeLanguages` property and are not taken into account when calculating for completed languages.

## bookingInfo

```
"bookingInfo": {
  "availabilityEnds": "2017-11-28T12:36:11+01:00",
  "availabilityStarts": "2018-06-28T12:36:11+01:00",
  "email": "info@test.be",
  "phone": null,
  "url": "http://www.kasteelvanhorst.be/praktisch",
  "urlLabel": {
    "en": "Reserve seats",
    "nl": "Reserveer plaatsen"
  },
},
```

* The dateTime for `availabilityEnds` and `availabilityStarts` may contain a deprecated dateTime format `2018-02-20T15:11:26.034Z`

* The three properties `email`, `url`, `phone` are not validated by the API and can all contain any string.

* [UNDER DEVELOPMENT] urlLabel should be a translatable field.

* bookingInfo may contain deprecated properties, these will be deleted from existing offers and should **NOT** be used in future development: `name`, `description`, `price`, `currency`

## contactPoint

* The three properties `email`, `url`, `phone` are not validated by the API and can all contain any string.
* It is possible to find an emailaddress under `phone` and vice versa.

```
"contactPoint": {
  "email": [],
  "phone": [
    "016 62 33 45"
  ],
  "url": [
    "http://www.kasteelvanhorst.be/families",
    "http://www.herita.be"
  ]
}
```


## creator

* The creator should contain the nickname for the UiTiD user that created the offer.

```
"creator": "Stiksels"
```

* It is possible that this field contains an emailaddress (for events and places) or a `UUID (nick)` for organizers

```
"creator": "user@info.org"
```

```
"creator": "86a02c65-696d-5b12-a9b1-9e3bc8e6303c (Stiksels)"
```

## creatorId

* [UNDER DEVELOPMENT] This field will contain the UUID for the UiTiD user that created the offer.

```
"creatorId": "86a02c65-696d-5b12-a9b1-9e3bc8e6303c"
```


## Missing geo-coordinates

* It is possible that not every place address has geo-coordinates.

```
"geo": {
  "latitude": 50.9321713,
  "longitude": 4.8320582
},
```


## priceInfo - translate name

* the name for a price should be a translatable field.

```
"priceInfo": [
  {
    "category": "base",
    "name": {
      "nl": "Basistarief",
      "fr": "Tarif de base",
      "en": "Base tariff",
      "de": "Basisrate"
      },
    "price": 6,
    "priceCurrency": "EUR"
  }
]
```
* It is possible that some older offers don't have translated names

```
"priceInfo": [
  {
    "category": "base",
    "name": "Basistarief",
    "price": 10.65,
    "priceCurrency": "EUR"
  },
  {
    "category": "tariff",
    "name": "Kortingstarief",
    "price": 9.65,
    "priceCurrency": "EUR"
  },
  {
    "category": "tariff",
    "name": "Kinepolis Student Card",
    "price": 7.95,
    "priceCurrency": "EUR"
  }
]
```
